    <h3>The Charcuterie Board For Men</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            You know what the problem with Charcuterie is? It’s girly. How on earth did meats and cheeses manage to
            become a staple of baby showers and bachelorette parties? It’s time for men to take back what’s theirs -
            unhealthy food. Poker night doesn’t need to be fancy, It needs to be delicious, it needs to put hair on your
            chest, it needs to bring Teddy Roosavelt back from the dead for a grizzly bear hunt. Damit, it needs to be
            Charduderie.
        <p><b> Walnut Wood </b></p>
        <p><b> Fully Customized for any badassery</b> </p>
        <p><b> Made with
                Lazers.</b></p>
        <p><b>Every Charduderie board
                comes with the Mountain guaruntee, if you break it while you hike Mt. Everest, or use it as a crash pad
                while you rock climb - you’ll get a new one for free.</b></p>
