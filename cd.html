  <h3>The Charcuterie Board For Men</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      You know what the problem with Charcuterie is? It’s girly. How on earth did meats and cheeses manage to
      become a staple of baby showers and bachelorette parties? It’s time for men to take back what’s theirs -
      unhealthy food. Poker night doesn’t need to be fancy, It needs to be delicious, it needs to put hair on your
      chest, it needs to bring Teddy Roosavelt back from the dead for a grizzly bear hunt. Damit, it needs to be
      Charduderie.
    <p><b> Walnut Wood </b></p>
    <p><b> Fully Customized for any badassery</b> </p>
    <p><b> Made with
        Lazers.</b></p>
    <p><b>Every Charduderie board
        comes with the Mountain guaruntee, if you break it while you hike Mt. Everest, or use it as a crash pad
        while you rock climb - you’ll get a new one for free.</b></p>
